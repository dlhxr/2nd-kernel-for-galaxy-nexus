###2nd Kernel for Galaxy Nexus###

The kernel will find other path for booting.

Such as:
folder boot branch
/cache                        as system partition (Giving up /realdata/media/2nd/system because of some root problems)
/realdata/media/2nd/data      as data partition
/realdata/media/2nd/cache     as cache partition

or:
image boot branch
/realdata/media/rom/system.img    as system partition
/realdata/media/rom/data.img      as data partition
/realdata/media/rom/cache.img     as cache partition


Just use pack_boot.sh to repack the kernel.
