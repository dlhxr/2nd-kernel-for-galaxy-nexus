###2nd Kernel for Galaxy Nexus###

The kernel will find other path for booting.

image boot branch
/rdata/media/rom/system.img    as system partition
/rdata/media/rom/data.img      as data partition
/rdata/media/rom/cache.img     as cache partition

rdata is the real data partition in Galaxy Nexus.
/dev/block/platform/omap/omap_hsmmc.0/by-name/userdata

Just use pack_boot.sh to repack the kernel.
