###2nd Kernel for Galaxy Nexus###

The kernel will find other path for booting.

folder boot branch

/cache                     as system partition (Giving up /realdata/media/2nd/system because of some root problems)
/rdata/media/2nd/data      as data partition
/rdata/media/2nd/cache     as cache partition


Just use pack_boot.sh to repack the kernel.
